# Advanced_Calculator
This is an advanced calculator built using Python's math module. It supports various operations, including basic arithmetic, power, square root, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and factorials. The calculator provides a user-friendly command-line interface and handles different numeric operations efficiently.
Features

    Basic Arithmetic Operations:
        Addition (+)
        Subtraction (-)
        Multiplication (*)
        Division (/)
        Power (^)

    Advanced Mathematical Functions:
        Square Root (sqrt)
        Sine (sin)
        Cosine (cos)
        Tangent (tan)
        Logarithm (log)
        Factorial (factorial)

    Error Handling:
        Division by zero detection.
        Invalid input handling.
        Large number overflow detection for factorial calculations.

 ## Requirements

    Python 3.x

The math module is part of Python's standard library, so no additional dependencies are required.

## Example Usage

    When prompted, enter the number corresponding to the operation you'd like to perform.
    For arithmetic operations, input two numbers when requested. For operations like square root, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and factorials, input one number.
